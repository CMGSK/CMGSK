## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### My name is Carlos, welcome to my GitHub! Here's some info about me:

- I'm a software developer, cameraman, photographer and crazy Hatsune Miku fan!!
- I lived for two and a half months in Germany working as Full-Stack developer for an internship.
- Actual goals: learn Lua and Rust
- Useless fact: I'm slowly learning Japanese! Although my listening skills are still far from good i already memorized over 2000 Kanji!!
- Contact: Personal e-mail [carlosmgov7k@gmail.com] - phone [663 14 87 97].
- Languages: Native spanish, C2 English, N3 Japanese, A2 French

A lot of things are really old, from where i wrote my first lines, im still learning and I know some of my repos are not the most organized, clean or merely decent there could be, but I try my best to improve, be organized and learn methodologies and conventions about the things I do <3 I'm also self-taught in several of the things I have uploaded here so bear with the mess, I may just have to learn the ropes before being able to produce cleaner code.
